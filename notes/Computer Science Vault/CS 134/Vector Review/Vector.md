Describes a [[Direction]] in **any** number of dimensions
- Does NOT have a [[Position]]
- Stored as a [[Point]]
(x, y) is 2D vector
(x, y , z) is 3D vector
## Use Cases
- Direction of Movement, Velocity (Distance traveled over time)
- Vector Fields (i.e. Wind direction)
- Ray casting/Ray tracing
## Equations
Addition/Subtraction
[[Magnitude]] (Length)
[[Dot Product]] (Angle between vectors)
[[Cross Product]]
## Rays
A [[Ray]] has both: a Vector & [[Direction]].
## Normalize
$\frac{v}{|v|} = v'$
A vector with length of 1.
