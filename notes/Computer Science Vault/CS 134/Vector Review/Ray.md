A **Ray** has both [[Position]] & [[Direction]].
- Needs a [[Point]] (Position)
- Needs a [[Vector]] (Direction)
Let r be a Ray:
`r = ray( Point p, Vector d )`
## Parametric Form
`r(t) = o + td`
- `o` is the **origin** (initial point) of the ray
- `t` a parameter; a real value (0, infinity) (i.e. time)
- `d` the **direction vecto**r of the array
For:
1. Computing points along rays
2. Intersections between rays??
