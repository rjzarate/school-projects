Let A and B be Vectors:
`A x B = n |A| |B| sin w`
- w is the **angle** created by vectors A & B
- n is the Normal Vector

## Perpendicular
Finds the perpendicular vector (orthogonal) of 2 vectors
- 2 Vectors create a plane. Cross Product will find a vector that is perpendicular to that plane
### Finding a the Perpendicular Vector of a Plane
If you have a plane, you can use the edges of the **length** & **width** and create 2 vectors. Then, solve the Cross Product
