Let A and B be Vectors:
`A . B = |A| |B| cos w`
- w is the **angle** created by vectors A & B

`A . B = (x_A * x_B + y_A * y_B + ...) / (|A| |B|)`
- To find angle w:
- `w = cos^-1 (A . B)`

## Projection
The Dot Product of `A . B / |B|` can be thought of as:
- The **shadow of A casted onto B**
	- The light is **casted on the TIP of A**
