## Idea
Universe is "parallel"
- Nature itself
	- Weather, galaxy
## Technical
Speculative Computation
- A world where you compute EVERY possible scenario before hand
	- Ex. movement of a character is already precomputed; when player moves, throw the other precomputed
- Instantaneous response

Super-Linear Speedups
- Theory where using cache memory can make multi-cores run even faster
	- i.e. 4-core system runs 5x fast
