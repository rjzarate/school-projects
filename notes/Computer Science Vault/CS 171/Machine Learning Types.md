## Trial-and-Error (Brute Force)
Try random parameters until you find the right set
## Supervised
Target output
Has [[Objective Function]]
## Unsupervised
Only Inputs, NO TARGET OUTPUTS
- Good for data that isn't labeled (find similarities to create labels for the data)
## Reinforcement
Objective Function is a **reward function** that increase/decrease the reward based on the output
- Hard to find reward function :(
Different from Supervised:
- Reinforcement increases the Reward Function Score
- Supervised decreases the Objective Function Score
