1. Unordered; **cannot use indexing**
2. **Doesn't store duplicates**
3. Set is mutable
	1. Elements must be **immutable** and hash-able
## Constructor
`{x_0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n}`
## Indexing a Set
Must **cast into a [[Lists|List]]/[[Tuples|Tuple]]** to index through a Set
### Casting Sets into other Data Structures
Would basically remove duplicate elements
## Making an Empty Set
`set()`
Doing `{}` creates an empty [[Dictionaries|Dictionary]]
## Set Operations

### `in`
Can be used to check if an element is contained in a Set
- `if element in set:`
### Other Operations
